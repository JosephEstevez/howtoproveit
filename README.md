# 📘 howtoproveit

This is a personal project where I work through the exercises from *How to Prove It: A Structured Approach* by Daniel J. Velleman.

The goal is simple: solve each problem and write a clear, formal proof — both to sharpen my own proof-writing skills and to build a resource that could help others studying the same book.

## ✍️ What you'll find here

- My solutions to selected exercises, organized by chapter  
- Fully written formal proofs, focused on clarity and rigor  
- Occasional comments or informal outlines when helpful  

> 🛠️ Work in progress.
